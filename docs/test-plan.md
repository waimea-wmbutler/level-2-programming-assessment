# Plan for Testing the Program

The test plan lays out the actions and data I will use to test the functionality of my program.

Terminology:

- **VALID** data values are those that the program expects
- **BOUNDARY** data values are at the limits of the valid range
- **INVALID** data values are those that the program should reject

## Test 1: The First Room Working

    To get the results i needed, i had to create a room to work. it would display a number after asking the player for a prompt.

### Test Data To Use

    The test data was ASD and left. i selected these so that when i tested the code, i could test for non left or right answers. also testing invalid inputs.

### Expected Test Result

    Completing the test showed that if an invalid request was inserted, the program would ask again. and if a real input was chosen e.g. l, Left, LEFT or left, it would output the first value.
